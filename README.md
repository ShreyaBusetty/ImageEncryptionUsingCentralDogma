# Image Encryption and Decryption using Central Dogma with Chaotic System

## Overview

This project implements a secure image encryption and decryption system using the Central Dogma principle infused with chaotic dynamics. By integrating chaos theory into the encryption process, the system adds an additional layer of complexity, making it highly resistant to unauthorized decryption attempts.

## Description

The image encryption and decryption system utilize a combination of Central Dogma, a concept from molecular biology, and chaotic dynamics to ensure robust security. Central Dogma represents the flow of genetic information within a biological system, which is analogous to the encryption and decryption process in this context.

Chaotic dynamics, inspired by chaos theory, introduce unpredictability and non-linearity into the encryption algorithm, enhancing the complexity of the encryption key generation and ciphering process. This makes it exceedingly difficult for unauthorized parties to decipher the encrypted image without possessing the correct decryption key.

## Features

- Image encryption using Central Dogma infused with chaotic dynamics
- Decryption of encrypted images using the corresponding decryption key
- Implementation of chaotic systems such as Lorenz or Logistic map for generating encryption keys
- Support for various image formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG, BMP)

## Usage

1. **Encryption**:
   - Provide the image to be encrypted as input.
   - Utilize the encryption algorithm, incorporating Central Dogma and chaotic dynamics, to generate a secure encryption key.
   - Encrypt the image using the generated key, producing the encrypted image file.

2. **Decryption**:
   - Input the encrypted image along with the corresponding decryption key.
   - Apply the decryption algorithm to retrieve the original image.

3. **Integration with Chaotic Systems**:
   - Customize the encryption process by selecting different chaotic systems (e.g., Lorenz system, Logistic map) for generating encryption keys.
   - Experiment with various parameters of chaotic systems to fine-tune the encryption strength and complexity.
